with Angular CLI version 6.0.8.\nDevelopment server\nRun npm install or yarn to install dependencies.\nRun ng serve for serving a demo app (inside /apps/demo). Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files (both demo and library).\nDevelopment flow\nEverything (fix or feature to the lib) should be done on separate branch branched from development. Once you are done, please rebase your branch to current development and resolve your conflicts before issuing an PR. Commit messages sould be per these instructions. This is making sure that CHANGELOG.md is generated correctly once we decide to publish a new version.\nFollowing workspaces are available:\n\nprojects/sticos-widgets - place where libraries are found\nsrc - place where you can consume your library to test it in demo app before you release a version\n\nTo get a new version of the NPM package create a PR towards the master branch.\nDevelopment commands\nThis library scripts inside template is compatible with both yarn and npm run.\nScript list:\n\nbuild:lib - building a library without publishing it (results are in sticos-widgets folder)\ncompodoc - generate documentation (results are in documentation folder, read here for more details how to document components)\n\nPeer-dependencies\nThere is no sense that our library will ever need a strong dependency (project.json located in projects/sticos-widgets/). Instead, list everything you need in peerDependencies (inversion of control, consuming apps should install those dependencies, and npm/yarn will warn if those are missing). Also please add those peer dependencies in installation guide here, unless they are normal @angular dependencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n
